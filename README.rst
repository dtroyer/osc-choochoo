OpenStackClient reference transoprtation plugin module

The OSC plugin system is designed so that the plugin need only be
properly installed for OSC to find and use it.  It utilizes the
``setuptools`` entry points mechanism to advertise to OSC the
plugin module and supported commands.

**osc-choochoo** is an OpenStackClient (OSC) plugin implementation that
demonstrates the effect on nearby rail transporation activity on
developer productivity via OSC's extension mechanism.  It adds
two commands: ``train list`` and ``train show``.
